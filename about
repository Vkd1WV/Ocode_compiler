What if all declared types were classes
	could there be implicit member selection if there is only one member?

the only fundamental operations are
	declarations
		constants
		variables
		classes
		functions
	assignments
	reference / dereference
	function calls
	label / jump
	if / else

for simplicity we need to assume only one data type: unsigned qword

First:
	variable declarations (one type)
	assignments
	expressions

Second:
	function calls

fourth:
	ref / deref (arithmetic depends on typesizes)?


Enumerated types should each be in their own namespace

REFERENCES
	With Ref operator
		variables must be implicitly dereferenced
		reference passing must be done explicitly
	Without ref operator
		all variables need to be dereferenced to get their value
		constants do not need to be dereferenced, but may for consistancy
		passing anything to a function always passes the reference allows us to make explicit whether they are in or out.

IC is one operation per line. Operator first. all arguments are in hex 0x

Primary values are either constants prefixed with #, or pointers to the symbol table
