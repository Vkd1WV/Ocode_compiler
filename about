What if all declared types were classes
	could there be implicit member selection if there is only one member?

the only fundamental operations are
	declarations
		constants
		variables
		classes
		functions
	assignments
	reference / dereference
	function calls
	label / jump
	if / else


for simplicity we need to assume only one data type: unsigned qword

First:
	variable declarations (one type)
	assignments
	expressions
